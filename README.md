# InventoryAppStage1

CRITERIA | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
-- | --
Overall Layout | No UI is required for this project.Hint: At minimum, you will need a main activity that has methods to read data, a Contract Java class, and a DbHelper Java class.Note: Even though UI is not required for this Stage, we highly recommend that you test your insert/read methods with log calls. Often, students do not realize their code has SQL syntax errors until the app is run and the methods are called which results in the project not passing.
